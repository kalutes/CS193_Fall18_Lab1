# Aditya Gandhi's First CS193 Homework (!!!)
Aditya Gandhi really likes CS, and thus far, he really like CS193. One might even say its his favorite course. Some of the reasons why are listed below:
- they have cool presentations
- they had that one _"whats the curve"_ _"pretty thicc"_ joke (yes this merited being in its own point)
- the indian ethnicity guy **(?)** he asked a question to after class seemed nice
- the instructors are thorough and actually get information across fairly well, integrating _just enough_ comedy to keep everyone engaged throughout
- building on the previous point, it's a class that doesn't just keep you awake, it keeps you invested and engaged too, which is not easy to find, and that's an excellent trait
- they answer questions on EdStem pretty quickly and thoroughly, haven't asked any myself bc others had asked those before me and their answers were super helpful
- i look forward to seeing you guys next week, ```slay```
